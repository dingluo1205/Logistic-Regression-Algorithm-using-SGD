# Logistic-Regression-Algorithm-using-SGD

This logistic regression algorithm with L2 regularization is used for predicting income from census data. 
It will predict the predict the probability that a person earns more than $50k per year.
Meanwhile, I used stochastic gradient descent to train the model and got more than 90% accuracy of both training and validation sets.
